# Detailed Solution and Approach

To develop an AI/ML model for automatic detection of craters and boulders from Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) images, we propose a comprehensive solution leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques. The approach involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Start by preprocessing the OHRC images to selenoreference them using the auxiliary information provided. This involves correcting for any geometric distortions and aligning the images to a common lunar reference frame.

2. **Model Training**: Utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, such as U-Net, designed for image segmentation tasks. Train the model on labeled datasets where craters and boulders are annotated. The model will learn to identify features corresponding to craters and boulders of various shapes and sizes.

3. **Data Augmentation**: To improve the model's robustness, perform data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and contrast adjustments to simulate different illumination conditions and perspectives.

4. **Detection and Quantification**: Once trained, the model will predict the locations and boundaries of craters and boulders in new OHRC images. Post-processing techniques will be applied to refine these predictions and filter out false positives.

5. **Selenographic Positioning and Size Calculation**: Develop an algorithm to calculate the selenographic coordinates and diameters of the detected craters and boulders. This involves mapping the pixel coordinates from the segmented images to lunar coordinates.

6. **Shape File Generation**: Create polygonal shape files or other geospatial data formats that contain the boundaries and relevant attributes (size, position) of the detected craters and boulders.

7. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score by comparing the detected features against a manually labeled validation set.

### Tools and Technology Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning), OpenCV (for image processing), GDAL (for geospatial data handling)
- **Software**: QGIS (for shape file handling and visualization)

## Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach from downloading the data to deploying the solution using the Chandrayaan-2 raw data.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Download and Prepare the Data

First, download the OHRC images from the provided Chandrayaan-2 data portal.

1. Visit the [Chandrayaan-2 Map Browse](https://chmapbrowse.issdc.gov.in/MapBrowse/) website.
2. Search for the OHRC images you are interested in.
3. Download the images along with any associated metadata or auxiliary files.

#### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries. You can use a virtual environment for this purpose.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv crater_detection_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
crater_detection_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source crater_detection_env/bin/activate

# Install necessary libraries
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python scikit-learn geopandas gdal flask
```

#### 3. Preprocess the Images

Use the auxiliary information provided with the images to selenoreference them.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from osgeo import gdal

def selenoreference_image(image_path, projection_info_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    projection_info = gdal.Open(projection_info_path)
    geotransform = projection_info.GetGeoTransform()
    rows, cols = image.shape
    aligned_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, geotransform, (cols, rows))
    return aligned_image

# Example usage
aligned_image = selenoreference_image('path/to/OHRC_image.jpg', 'path/to/projection_info.tif')
cv2.imwrite('aligned_OHRC_image.jpg', aligned_image)
```

#### 4. Label the Data

Manually annotate some images to create a labeled dataset. You can use tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) for this purpose. Save the annotations in a suitable format (e.g., mask images).

#### 5. Train the Model

Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, such as U-Net, for crater and boulder detection.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
import cv2

def build_unet_model(input_shape):
    inputs = Input(input_shape)
    conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
    conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv1)
    pool1 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv1)
    conv2 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pool1)
    conv2 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv2)
    pool2 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv2)
    up1 = UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(pool2)
    up1 = concatenate([up1, conv2], axis=3)
    conv3 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(up1)
    conv3 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv3)
    up2 = UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(conv3)
    up2 = concatenate([up2, conv1], axis=3)
    conv4 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(up2)
    conv4 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv4)
    outputs = Conv2D(1, (1, 1), activation='sigmoid')(conv4)
    model = Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def load_dataset(image_paths, annotation_paths):
    images = [cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) for image_path in image_paths]
    annotations = [cv2.imread(annotation_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) for annotation_path in annotation_paths]
    return images, annotations

# Load the dataset
image_paths = ['path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.jpg']
annotation_paths = ['path/to/annotation1.png', 'path/to/annotation2.png']
images, annotations = load_dataset(image_paths, annotation_paths)
train_images, test_images, train_annotations, test_annotations = train_test_split(images, annotations, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
input_shape = (256, 256, 1)
model = build_unet_model(input_shape)
model.fit(np.array(train_images), np.array(train_annotations), epochs=10, batch_size=4, validation_data=(np.array(test_images), np.array(test_annotations)))
```

#### 6. Detect Craters and Boulders

Use the trained model to detect craters and boulders in new images.

```python
def detect_craters_boulders(model, image):
    image = cv2.resize(image, (256, 256))
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=-1)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    prediction = model.predict(image)
    prediction = (prediction > 0.5).astype(np.uint8)
    return prediction[0, :, :, 0]

# Example usage
image = cv2.imread('aligned_OHRC_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
prediction = detect_craters_boulders(model, image)
cv2.imwrite('detected_craters_boulders.png', prediction)
```

#### 7. Calculate Selenographic Position and Size

Map the detected features to lunar coordinates.

```python
def calculate_selenographic_position_and_size(prediction, geotransform):
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(prediction, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    craters_boulders = []
    for contour in contours:
        area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
        if area > 50:  # Filter small contours
            x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
            center_x, center_y = x + w // 2, y + h // 2
            selenographic_x = geotransform[0] + center_x * geotransform[1]
            selenographic_y = geotransform[3] + center_y * geotransform[5]
            diameter = max(w, h)
            craters_boulders.append((selenographic_x, selenographic_y, diameter))
    return craters_boulders

# Example usage
geotransform = gdal.Open('path/to/projection_info.tif').GetGeoTransform()
craters_boulders = calculate_selenographic_position_and_size(prediction, geotransform)
```

#### 8. Generate Shape Files

Export the detected features as geospatial data files.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

def create_shape_file(craters_boulders, output_path):
    geometries = [Polygon([(x - d / 2, y - d / 2), (x + d / 2, y - d / 2), (x + d / 2, y + d / 2), (x - d / 2, y + d / 2)]) for x, y, d in craters_boulders]
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': geometries, 'diameter': [d for _, _, d in craters_boulders]})
    gdf.to_file(output_path, driver='ESRI Shapefile')

# Example usage
create_shape_file(craters_boulders, 'craters_boulders.shp')
```

#### 9. Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

def evaluate_model(predictions, ground_truths):
    precision = precision_score(ground_truths.flatten(), predictions.flatten())
    recall = recall_score(ground_truths.flatten(), predictions.flatten())
    f1 = f1_score(ground_truths.flatten(), predictions.flatten())
    return precision, recall, f1

# Example usage
predictions = [detect_craters_boulders(model, image) for image in test_images]
ground_truths = test_annotations
precision, recall, f1 = evaluate_model(np.array(predictions), np.array(ground_truths))
print(f'Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1-score: {f1}')
```

#### 10. Deploy the Model

Deploy the model using Flask for real-time detection.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import io
from PIL import Image

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/detect', methods=['POST'])
def detect():
    file = request.files['image'].read()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(file)).convert('L

')
    image = np.array(image)
    prediction = detect_craters_boulders(model, image)
    craters_boulders = calculate_selenographic_position_and_size(prediction, geotransform)
    return jsonify(craters_boulders)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

# âœ… Proposed architecture/user diagram

Creating a comprehensive and effective presentation involves detailing each aspect of your proposed solution. Here's a structured approach to help you build the content and visuals for your PowerPoint presentation. I'll provide a proposed architecture/user diagram and a standard flow diagram for the project.

### 1. Detailed Solution and Approach (250-300 words)
The goal of this project is to develop a robust AI/ML model capable of automatically detecting craters and boulders of varying shapes and sizes from Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) images. The approach involves several key steps:

**Data Preparation**: Start with selenoreferencing the OHRC images using auxiliary information provided to ensure accurate spatial projection. Preprocess the images to enhance feature visibility and normalize illumination differences.

**Model Training**: Use a combination of traditional image processing techniques and modern AI/ML models. Begin with feature extraction using edge detection, contour detection, and texture analysis. Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on labeled datasets to identify craters and boulders. Use transfer learning with a pre-trained model to improve efficiency.

**Model Evaluation**: Develop evaluation metrics to assess accuracy and relevance. Use precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's performance. Compare detected features with manually annotated datasets to validate accuracy.

**Shape File Generation**: Once detection is complete, generate polygonal shape files for each detected feature. These files will include boundary coordinates, selenographic positions, and diameters of craters/boulders.

### 2. Tools and Technology Used (50 words)
**Programming Languages**: Python, C++
**Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, GDAL
**Technologies**: Image processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning, GIS Tools

### 3. Opportunities

### Example Code Snippet for Model Training

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Load and preprocess image
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (128, 128))
    image = image / 255.0
    return image.reshape(1, 128, 128, 1)

# Build CNN model
def build_model():
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 1)),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Train model
def train_model(model, train_images, train_labels):
    model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

# Example usage
image_path = 'path_to_image.png'
image = preprocess_image(image_path)
model = build_model()
# Assume train_images and train_labels are preloaded datasets
train_model(model, train_images, train_labels)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic CNN for binary classification, which can be extended and refined for the specific task of crater and boulder detection.
